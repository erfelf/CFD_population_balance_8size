# CFD_population_balance_8size
CFD code developed in Fortran to simulate agglomeration and breakup of particles in low shear rates
Multiphase flow simulation using population balance modeling 

Fluid solver uses SIMPLEC method to solve the background fluid
particles are solved using finite volume method ask me for more details at erf.niazi@gmail.com
